1.What are the different data types used in JavaScript variables in the provided code 
Integer- represents numbers  
Boolean- represents a true or false  
String – represents both letters and numbers  
Char- represents letters  
2.Explain the difference between Var, let and const in JavaScript 
Var and let is used to declare a variable and the variable created using the word can be 
changed many times while a const is used to declare variables that cannot be changed 
thought-out the code’s lifetime e.g. the number pie.  
3. why does JavaScript allow assigning different data types to the same variable. 
Unlike java where one needs to declare the type every time, JavaScript is flexible in that the 
type is determined by the value currently assigned to the variable. 
4. how does JavaScript handle variables declared but not initialized? Illustrate with an 
example from the code. 
The variable is assigned the value undefined. 
5. discuss the significance of variable names in programming and how they are used 
in JavaScript. 
A descriptive variable name makes it easier to read and understand  
A good name makes it easier to modify code. 
It's easier to identify where things are going wrong if for example the functions are clearly 
defined in what it does  
Choosing the right name ensures variables are used correctly  
6. What are the various numeric data types used in JavaScript 
Integer - represents numerical values  
BigInt – represents very large numeric values (up to 2^15) 
7. Explain the difference between integers, doubles, and Infinity in JavaScript with 
examples. 
Integers – they are whole numbers without decimal points e.g.  
Let intvalue = 4; 
Doubles – this are numbers with a decimal point  
Let double Value = 4.58 
Infinity – represents a number that exceeds JavaScript maximum limit  
8. How does JavaScript handle arithmetic operations involving different numeric 
data types? 
When one performs arithmetic operations on integers, JavaScript uses mathematical 
rules. JavaScript automatically converts integers to floating-point numbers when 
preforming operations with them. 
9. How are strings represented in JavaScript? 
Strings in JavaScript are represented in single or double quotes. E.g. “hello” ‘hello’ 
10. Discuss the difference between declaring strings with single quotes ('') and 
double quotes ("") in JavaScript. 
There are no functional differences between the two 
11. Explain why characters are automatically treated as strings in JavaScript. 
In JavaScript there is no separate char data type for individual characters. 
12. Explain the purpose of Boolean variables in JavaScript. 
Booleans represents logical values and only has two possible values. true and false. 
13. Discuss the concept of undefined in JavaScript variables and provide examples 
from the code. 
A variable is undefined if it has been declared but not assigned a value  
let name;  
console.log(name); // undefined 
14. How are Boolean variables useful in conditional statements and control flow in 
JavaScript? 
They are useful in if statements to control the program’s flow. If a condition evaluates to 
true the corresponding block of code executes. 
15. Describe the significance of the null value in JavaScript. 
Null value represents the intentional absence of any object or value. 
16. Differentiate between null and undefined in JavaScript. 
null is a value explicitly assigned to indicate "no value." 
undefined is the default state of a declared variable that has not been assigned a value. 
17. Provide an example from the code illustrating the use of null. 
let selected Value = null; // Value is intentionally set to null  
console.log (selected Value); 
18. Explain how objects are represented in JavaScript. 
objects are collections of key-value pairs where each key (property) is a string or symbol 
and the value can be of any data type. 
19. Discuss the structure and purpose of the countryInfo object in the provided 
code. 
Object declaration:  
the object is declared using the let keyword. It can be reassigned when needed. 
The object contains 2 key-value pairs: citizenship/idnumber 
Purpose: 
The object is used to group related information about the individual's nationality and id 
20. How can objects be nested within other objects in JavaScript? 
Objects can contain other objects as values, enabling the creation of complex data 
structures. 
21. Describe the purpose and structure of arrays in JavaScript. 
Arrays are used to store ordered collections of elements, which can be of any data type 
(numbers, strings, objects, etc.).  
Arrays are defined using square brackets ([]). 
22. Provide examples from the code demonstrating arrays containing different 
data types. 
let numbers = [1, 2, 3]; 
let mixedArray = [1, 'two', true]; 
23. Discuss the concept of "array of arrays" and its significance. 
An array can contain other arrays, which is useful for representing multi-dimensional 
data, like matrices. 
24. What are the conventions for naming variables in JavaScript? 
Variable names should start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($), and can 
contain alphanumeric characters. 
25. Discuss the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable 
names. 
A descriptive variable name makes it easier to read and understand  
A good name makes it easier to modify code. 
It's easier to identify where things are going wrong if for example the functions are clearly 
defined in what it does  
Choosing the right name ensures variables are used correctly 
26. Identify any variable naming conventions followed or violated in the provided 
code. 
CamelCase Convention (Followed): 
Variables like myRoom, myName, myKiswahiliMarks, bankBalance, yearsInHeaven 
follow the camelCase naming convention. 
Meaningful Variable Names (Followed): 
Variables like myRoom, name, myName, result, isAdmin, isPermitted, student, 
countryInfo, and marks  
Underscore in Variable Names (Violated): 
first_name uses an underscore 
Constants Naming (Followed): 
const phoneNumber  
Variable Names Starting with Lowercase (Followed): 
myRoom, myKiswahiliMarks, isAdmin, and firstChar. 
27 Explain the use of const keyword in JavaScript. 
it's used to declare variables whose value cannot be reassigned. It is commonly used for 
values that should remain constant throughout the execution of the program. 
28.Discuss why reassigning a value to a constant variable result in an error. 
Reassigning a const variable results in an error because const enforces immutability. 
29.Provide examples from the code demonstrating the declaration and use of 
constants. 
Declaration of a Constant: 
const phoneNumber = 254789567364; 
Example Use of the Constant: 
console.log(phoneNumber);
